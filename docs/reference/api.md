# REST API

Base URL: wherever `HTTP_ADDR` serves (default `http://localhost:8080`). All API routes are under `/api`; the same paths without `/api` serve the HTML web UI. Responses are JSON. List endpoints paginate with `cursor` and `limit`.

> This documents the intended MVP surface. The authoritative reference is your build's README and code — if a request here is rejected, check there and treat the code as truth.

## Health & stats

### `GET /health`
Reports process health, including the active source (RPC or SoroTrail) and, in standalone mode, database reachability.

### `GET /api/stats`
Overview counters: total contracts seen, total events, last-updated ledger (standalone mode) or last-synced position (upstream mode).

## Contracts

### `GET /api/contracts`
List every known contract, newest-activity-first.

**Query parameters:** `search` (partial contract ID match), `limit`, `cursor`.

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/contracts?limit=20'
```

### `GET /api/contracts/{id}`
Summary for one contract: event count, first/last seen ledger, event-type breakdown.

## Events

### `GET /api/contracts/{id}/events`
A contract's events, newest-first.

**Query parameters:**

| Param | Description |
|---|---|
| `type` | `contract`, `system`, or `diagnostic` |
| `tx_hash` | Restrict to events from one transaction |
| `topic` | Match by decoded topic (see build semantics) |
| `from_ledger` / `to_ledger` | Inclusive ledger bounds |
| `limit` / `cursor` | Pagination |

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/contracts/CC.../events?type=contract&limit=50'
```

### `GET /api/events/{id}`
Fetch a single event by its unique id (TOID), fully decoded.

### `GET /api/events/buckets` and `GET /api/contracts/{id}/buckets`
Aggregate event counts into contiguous half-open `[start, end)` time buckets over a `[from, to)` RFC3339 timestamp range.

- **Timestamp bucketed:** `ledger_closed_at` (the on-chain ledger close time, not `created_at` ingest time, so backfilled history is placed at its true on-chain time).
- **Half-open boundaries:** Each bucket covers `[start, end)` (`start <= ledger_closed_at < end`). An event whose `ledger_closed_at` equals a bucket boundary lands in the bucket starting at that boundary; an event at `to` is excluded.
- **Empty buckets:** Quiet intervals within `[from, to)` are returned with `"count": 0` rather than omitted.
- **Bounds & cap:** `interval` defaults to `1h` and accepts durations between `1m` and `168h` (`7d`), such as `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `1h`, `6h`, `1d`. A single request may produce at most `500` buckets (`400 Bad Request` when `(to - from) / interval > 500`).
- **Upstream mode (`SOURCE_MODE=sorotrail`):** Buckets are derived from the bounded recent-event scan and report `"approximate": true` whenever the scan does not exhaust the upstream history.

**Query parameters:**

| Param | Description |
|---|---|
| `from` | Required inclusive lower bound (RFC3339 timestamp) |
| `to` | Required exclusive upper bound (RFC3339 timestamp) |
| `interval` | Bucket width (`1m` .. `7d`, default `1h`; max 500 buckets) |
| `contract_id` | Optional Soroban contract strkey (`GET /api/events/buckets` only) |
| `type` | Optional `contract`, `system`, or `diagnostic` |
| `topic` | Optional decoded topic filter (bare symbol or JSON object) |

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/events/buckets?from=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z&to=2024-01-01T06:00:00Z&interval=1h&type=contract'
```

## Pagination

List responses include `next_cursor`; pass it back as `cursor` for the next page. A null `next_cursor` means you've reached the end. Treat the cursor as opaque.

## Errors

Errors return an envelope with an HTTP status matching the failure class — `400` for invalid input (naming the offending parameter), `404` for an unknown contract or event, `500` for server faults. In upstream mode, an unreachable SoroTrail instance surfaces as a `502`-class error rather than a silent empty result.
